    <h1>Hi recruiter!</h1>
    

    <h2>Why have you landed in this page?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Someone thinks you haven't provided the basic info for a good offer, and wants to help you be more efficient at your job. </li>
<li>Don't take this as a criticism, the person sending you to this page didn't mean any harm, just to let you know there are better ways at recruiting people.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="http://bfy.tw/Zw" title="Too long; didn't read">TL;DR</a></h2>
<p>Give the person you're trying to recruit, when you first contact him/her, <em>accurate</em> info he/she's going to ask sooner or later (company, salary and full job description).</p>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<h3>Describe your company</h3>
<ul>
<li>It would be great if the offer included a company overview, with links to the company's website, linkedin profile or the like. If it'd also link to the careers/job section, it'd be great.</li>
<li>This tries to get rid of the <em>"I'm recruiting on behalf of an important client who has various different positions in the UK"</em> or <em>"I'm recruiting for a position with an established and successful software firm"</em> kind of messages. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The contacted person is gonna ask anyway.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3>Describe the job</h3>
<ul>
<li>It would be great if the position description included detailed (as much as possible) information about the responsabilities, skills and requirements of the job. <ul>
<li>Too many buzzwords or the search for ninjas/rockstars is too much. </li>
<li>Take a look at the info (most) companies include at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs">StackOverflow jobs</a> (I'm not affiliated in any manner to StackOverflow or any of its subsidiaries, just think they encourage companies to post more relevant info).
 It helps candidates consider whether they would be really interested or not. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The contacted person is gonna ask anyway.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3>Salary</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The job offer should include salary, or at least a <em>reasonable</em> salary range (not something like "between 30k and 60k"). </p>
<ul>
<li>Take a look at <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2015/03/30/just-put-the-salary-range-in-your-job-ad-already/">this article from a Forbes contributor</a>. Here the author, Liz Ryan, says <em>"It is unethical and tacky to ask job-seekers for their current salary level"</em>. Asides from being subject to lies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>we pay as little as possible</em> philosophy, or the concealment of that information is inefficient. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The contacted person is gonna ask anyway.</strong></p>
